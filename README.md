# Verilog-A-photonic_model_library

## Overview

This repository contains photonic device model libraries and sample testbenches for electronics and photonics co-design. This model library is designed to capture key device behaviors including optical loss, back reflection, nonlinearity, high-frequency response, and noise characteristics. The models are based on the interoperable Verilog-A language and can be imported into standard electronic circuit simulators. The sample testbenches are currently provided as a Keysight Advanced Design System (ADS) workspace, with potential support for other simulators in future releases.

This work builds on our recent study (K.Kawahara and T.Baba, [arXiv:2410.02282](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02282)), which has been accepted for publication in IEEE Journal of Microwaves.

## System Requirements

### Supported Platforms

The model library can be used with most electronic circuit simulators that support Verilog-A import.
The execution requirements for the sample testbench comply with those of Keysight ADS 2025.

- https://docs.keysight.com/display/engdocads/ADS+2025+System+Requirements

### Software Dependencies

No dependencies. The models can be used in any simulator that supports Verilog-A.

### Tested Environments

The sample testbench has been verified on the following environments:

#### Environment 1
- **OS**: Microsoft Windows 11 Home
- **Simulator**: Keysight ADS 2025 Update 0_1.
- **Processor**: 10th Gen Intel Core i7-10510U  
- **Memory**: 32 GB RAM  

#### Environment 2
- **OS**: CentOS Stream 8
- **Simulator**: Keysight ADS 2022 Update 2.
- **Processor**: 12th Gen Intel Core i7-12700
- **Memory**: 64 GB RAM  

**Note:**  
Some testbenches **did not run properly on ADS 2019 Update1**, and **2022 Update2 or later** is recommended.

## Installation Guide

The import procedure for Verilog-A models follows the standard method of each simulator.  
This section explains how to set up the sample testbench in Keysight ADS.

Start by unarchiving the ADS workspace. Open ADS and navigate to **File â†’ Unarchive...**.  
Select the provided archive file **`opt_model_demo_wrk.7zads`** and specify the directory where the workspace should be created.

When prompted in the **Select Items to Unarchive** window, ensure all items are checked.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f1f54a4-232e-405a-89a4-e94d772b155b" width="60%">

Next, in the **Unarchiving Workspace Options** window, select **`opt_model_demo_wrk`**.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84df9aec-72de-41dd-8953-95e1ab5f3a3b" width="60%">

Click **Finish** to complete the unarchiving process.

Copy the **`veriloga`** directory from the provided distribution into the unarchived workspace directory (`opt_model_demo_wrk`).
The Verilog-A models are not included in the ADS archive, so they must be copied manually into the workspace directory for the simulations to work correctly.
